				<h3>About</h3> 
					<p>Hi, my name is Angela Low, and this is my website. Here you'll find tutorials about fun and meaningful DIY weekend projects big and small, inspired by what we percieve to need in our daily modern life.</p>

					<p>Papermoon was born out of an idea that we could actually make our own art, tools, toys, gifts, food, and devices without contributing to big souless entities, or needless consumerism. My boyfriend pointed out it's also intended to serve as a creativity sparking platform. Anyway, this blog is simply meant to serve up an alternative path.</p>

					<p>I hope you'll enjoy the tutorials and materials serve up here as I was as happy to make them. I'm open to feedback and comments, and simply hearing from you. Do enjoy!</p>
